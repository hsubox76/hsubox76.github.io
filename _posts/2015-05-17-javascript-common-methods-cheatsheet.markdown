[Cheatsheet here](http://www.christinahsuholland.com/js-cheatsheet/)

I was talking to some of my classmates the other day about how we always get native JavaScript array methods mixed up. Even if you're fairly experienced, it's easy to get them confused with Underscore.js methods and array methods from other languages, if JavaScript isn't your only language.

So I made [this cheatsheet](http://www.christinahsuholland.com/js-cheatsheet/)! I set it up in Angular, which may have been overkill. It was just the first thing that popped into my head. Column headers are clickable to see only methods that apply to that data type. Each example box is clickable and takes you to the Mozilla Developer's Network documentation page for that method.
