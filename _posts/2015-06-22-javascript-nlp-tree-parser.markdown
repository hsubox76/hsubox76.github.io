As part of the [Crowd Parser project](http://www.christinahsuholland.com/crowd-parser-thesis-project/), I was working on a more sophisticated dependency tree parser to make an improved negation layer and make sure the positive/negative words used to score the tweet were actually referring to the keyword we were looking at.

I never got this finished in time to incorporate into Crowd Parser, but it's working in a basic state, with input fields for crowdsourcing the job of finding holes in the algorithm.
