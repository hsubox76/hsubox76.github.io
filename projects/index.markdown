### Crowd Parser


Crowd Parser was a fairly ambitious final project tackled over 3 weeks by our team of 3. The goal was to gather large amounts of data (tweets from Twitter), process them with a sentiment parser, and display the results in an intuitive and flashy 3D display. We gathered, stored, and indexed over 6 million tweets, processed them with 4 algorithms we wrote, and made an intuitive display capable of zooming from tens of thousands of tweets to an individual tweet.

### ItemChimp


ItemChimp was a "Greenfield" project that our team of 4 created from scratch over about a week. It compares reviews from different shopping sites for any given item, both with traditional views (review lists, score averages) and a graphical display using D3. I was responsible for the D3 review display and building the reviews page using React, as well as troubleshooting the Wal-Mart and Best Buy API queries.

### Poetry Pal


Poetry Pal was a [solo two-day MVP project I did at Hack Reactor](http://www.christinahsuholland.com/mvp-project-poetry-pal-with-angular-js-and-mongodb/). This app helps beginning poets work past the tricky hurdles of rhyme and syllable count for different poetry forms by giving them immediate feedback on both. Poetry Pal uses a clean, intuitive Angular-based UI that gives easy-to-understand feedback, and checks words against a 120,000 word pronunciation dictionary derived from the Moby Pronunciation dictionary and stored in MongoDB.

### NLP Tree Parser


This is a personal project I started working on after not finding any native JavaScript tree parsers.

### Hack Feed


Hack Feed was a 4 person project over a 4 day timeframe. The job was to add features to an existing codebase while modifying the original code as little as possible. The original project was an enhanced UI for viewing Hacker News. My specific contribution was to add testing (Karma/Protractor), improve authentication, and create a graph visualization engine for the relationship of posts in a thread.
